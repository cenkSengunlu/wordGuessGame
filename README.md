# Word Guess Game

A word guessing game I made to work with the JavaScript DOM. Sorry, the website is not responsive.

Rules & Information:
1. The word to be guessed is chosen randomly from the word pool.
2. In order to make a guess, the number of letters of the word you write must be equal to the number of letters specified.
3. The word pool includes the objects we see all the time in our daily life.
4. Ten guesses.
5. Letters of the word are not given.
6. You can see the correct word when the guessing rights are over.
7. After each guess, the number of correctly guessed letters and the correctly placed letters are added to the table with the guess.
8. Have fun.
